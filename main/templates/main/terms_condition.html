        <p>Welcome to the Figma, Inc. (“Figma”, “us” “we” or “our”) website. Please read these Terms of Service 
            (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our websites including figma.com, figma.com/community 
            (“Figma Community”), designsystems.com and any other websites that we may later own or operate (each, a “Site,
            ” and collectively, the “Sites”); our mobile and desktop applications (“Apps”), our application program 
            interfaces (“APIs”), our software development kits (“SDKs”) and our collaboration tools and other products 
            and services we may later own or operate (collectively, with the Sites, Apps, APIs, and SDKs, the “Services”).
             Figma Community is our Site where Figma users can share and sell resources (“Community Resources”) with other
              users. Figma Community is one of the Services we provide, but Community Resources, which are created by 
              users, are not part of the Services we provide and are instead governed by your terms with the creator 
              (“Community Creator”) of the Community Resource.</p> <br/>
        
              <p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO 
                THESE TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION BELOW, 
                THESE TERMS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING
                 AND FINAL ARBITRATION SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR
                  CONSOLIDATED ACTION.

                <p>1. Agreement to these Terms</p> <br/>
                <p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, do not 
                    use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your
                     employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
                      company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that 
                      company or other legal entity.</p><br/>

                <p>2. Changes to the Terms or Services</p> <br/>
                <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, at our sole discretion. If we do so, we will let you know either 
                    by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. If you continue to use the
                     Services after such a change, you are indicating that you agree to the modified Terms. We may also 
                     change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice or liability,
                      at our sole discretion.</p><br/>
                
                <p>3. Service Terms</p> <br/>
                <p>3.1. Who may use the Services. You may only use the Services if you are old enough to consent 
                    (by yourself and not by a parent or guardian) to share your data under applicable law. For example, 
                    you must be 13 years or older under most United States’ law, or 16 years or older under California 
                    or European Union law. If you are using Figma Community, you must be at least 16 years or older.</p><br/>

                <p>3.2. Use Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly authorized in these Terms, you will not, and will 
                    ensure your employees, contractors, and other persons associated with your Figma account (“Authorized 
                    Users”) do not, and will not encourage or assist third parties to: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, 
                    disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, 
                    ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant to the Services (except to the extent that such a restriction
                     is impermissible under applicable law); (ii) provide, sell, resell, transfer, sublicense, lend, 
                     distribute, rent, or otherwise allow others to access or use the Services; (iii) copy, modify, 
                     create derivative works of, or remove proprietary notices from the Services; or (iv) circumvent 
                     any technical limitations implemented by Figma.</p><br/>
                
                <p>3.3. Acceptable Use Policy. You will comply with, and will ensure your Authorized Users comply with, 
                    Figma’s Acceptable Use Policy available <a href="www.figma.com/aup" class="text-blue-600">here</a>.</p><br/>

                <p>3.4. Authorized Users; Accounts. As part of the registration process, you will identify an 
                    administrative username and password for your Figma account. You represent and warrant that all 
                    registration information, including with respect to the list of domains owned or controlled by you 
                    for purposes of domain capture, you provide is truthful, accurate, and complete, and that you will 
                    maintain the accuracy of such information. You are responsible and liable for maintaining control 
                    over your account, including the confidentiality of your username and password, and are solely 
                    responsible and liable for all activities that occur on or through your account and all Authorized 
                    Users’ accounts, whether authorized by you or not.</p><br/>

                <p>3.5. Feedback; Use Rights. We welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions (“Feedback”). As we need to
                     be able to freely work with your Feedback to improve the Services, you hereby irrevocably transfer 
                     and assign all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights, such as 
                     copyrights or trade secrets) in and to the Feedback, including any and all “moral rights” that you 
                     might have in such Feedback, and you hereby forever waive and agree never to assert any and all 
                     “moral rights” you may have in the Feedback. Additionally, Figma will have the right to collect 
                     and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use, and performance of various 
                     aspects of the Services, and related systems and technologies, and Figma will be free (during and 
                     after the term) to use such data and information to maintain, improve, and enhance any products or 
                     services.</p><br/>

                <p>3.6. Reservation of Rights. As between the parties, Figma owns all right, title, and interest in the 
                    Services, and you own all right, title, and interest in any application(s) and/or material(s) that are
                     developed by you on the Services or uploaded to the Services by you (“Customer Materials”). Except 
                     as expressly set forth in these Terms, each party retains all right, title, and interest in and to 
                     its intellectual property rights. All rights not expressly granted are reserved, and no license, 
                     covenant, immunity, transfer, authorization, or other right will be implied, by reason of statute, 
                     estoppel, or otherwise, under these Terms.</p><br/>

                <p>3.7. Patent Assertion Entities. A “Patent Assertion Entity,” sometimes referred to as a ‘non-practicing
                     entity’ or a ‘patent troll,’ is (a) any entity that derives or seeks to derive most of its revenue 
                     from the offensive assertion of patent rights, or (b) directly or indirectly controls, is controlled
                      by, or is under common control with an entity described in (a). If you are a Patent Assertion Entity
                       or are acting on behalf of, or for the benefit of a Patent Assertion Entity, you will not assert, 
                       or authorize, assist, encourage, or enable any third party to assert, any claim, or pursue any 
                       actions, suits, proceedings, or demands, against Figma or its affiliates that allege that the 
                       Services infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights (including
                        patents). This section will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.</p><br/>

                <p>4. License</p><br/>
                <p>4.1. License to Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, we hereby grant you a 
                    limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license worldwide (with the exception of 
                    (i) jurisdictions that are embargoed or designated as supporting terrorist activities by the United 
                    States Government and (ii) jurisdictions whose laws do not permit engaging in business with Figma or
                     use of the Services) for you to access and use the Services for your internal business or personal 
                     purposes, depending on your account type. If you have a free account you may use the Services for 
                     business or personal purposes, but paid accounts are intended for business use only.PERFORMANCE </p>
